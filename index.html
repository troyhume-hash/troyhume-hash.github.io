prologue…
We hear a loud crash and then click. “What is that!”
Dad says, and he shoulders his rifle. Mom turns on a flashlight. And then…it happens so quickly, but I have the best aim with a bow, I shoot the thing down with one arrow. I’ve never missed once, but there is a first time for everything, and it gets up and kills mom right in front of us I blame myself to this day. Dad now shoots it dead and as he checks for a pulse another sneaks in and I don’t see it and it kills him to…


So one day I woke up to find it was completely black like I could not see anything outside so I went downstairs to see my mom in the kitchen oh did I mention that the lights still work yeah it’s weird but anyway yeah so she looked up and said, “ hey honey how are you?” so I replied, “good, why is it pi-” “because of a burrito!” she said it kinda angrily and she cut me off so I knew that something was wrong so I said, “ok.” “Sorry honey, it’s just that it’s scarier for me cause I’m scared of the dark.” “it’s ok mom. Wait, your scared of the dark?” “yes.” and then I walk out side with a flashlight and and rabid burrito comes out of nowhere and I pull out my flaregun and the dogito goes down in cheese and then a animal that I have never seen before come into sight and it screams and runs at me and as it get closer I see it is also a burrito and that is when it hits me this no ordinary burrito covering the sun it is a burrito invasion I kill the wild burrito and go inside and tell mom and she calls the police and tells them what I told her and they believed her I’ll admit I thought that they would laugh and say she was nuts and then the screams started on the other side of phone, gun shots and then human screams thats when mom calls dad and tells him to and by the way my dad is in the army and if the army can’t kill these burritos then nobody can and then I go up stairs to get the bow that my dad got me, a 100 pound draw weight and I checked my flaregun ammo I had about 50 left so that was good and I put them in a backpacking backpack I check my arrows still have 400 which is 8 quivers 50 in each and then I go down stairs long bow in one hand and knife in other. Mom has a 22 rifle on her back and a revolver on her hip in it’s holster she also has a backpack and I hear the chinkle of rifle rounds and pistol she says, “your dad will meet us at the base.” and when she says base I know she means the military base near us and then I go back up stairs and pack three suitcases full and three backpacks suitcases with clothes and stuff like that and in the backpacks I put like rope and survival stuff like that and the next thing I know we are at the place that we where planning to meet at when we hear the familiar roar of dads truck we both sigh with relief and then we hear him yell, “Violet, Will, you guys alright?” “Yes, are you?” we say at the same time “Yeah.” Dad parks his truck in the parking area right next to moms car and we help him close the door and then we go to the main fortress and there is a massive barbed wire fence and behind it is a 200 foot high cement and steel wall like it is almost impossible to get into the only way in is if you have a super special keycard and luckily my dad has one of the cards to get in. And we get in and go to the sleeping rooms and unpack. Next, that’s when it happened, we hear a loud crash and then the clicking. “What is that!”

 Part two
10 years later…
So now I’m in the resistance and I made two friends and their parents are dead too oh, and I’m twenty two now so yay I guess. My friend's names are Harley, and Hailey so when we go on reconnaissance missions where we try to find survivors and supplies to. Are leaders believe that the burritos are taking people now instead of killing them. I’ve been part of the resistance for like three or four years now, most of us are either kin of someone in the military like my dad or Hailey’s mom who was a nurse, and Harley’s mom and dad his dad was a pilot and his mom was friends with Hailey’s and a nurse too. So anyway Harley came over and asked if me & Hailey and I wanted to go to a new spot he found and just hang out. Which I have not done with them so I’m all for it. But it is protocol for us to take weapons with us. Harley takes two axes, and Hailey takes a bat with rusty nails through it. So we go to the place where I went to school.
